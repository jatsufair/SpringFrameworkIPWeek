unorganized notes taken as I go.

* PluralSight
** Java Spring
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/spring-framework-spring-fundamentals/table-of-contents
*** What is Spring
**** Dependency Injection framework
*** Spring configuration using Java
**** @Beans
decorator over methods

by default they are singletons meaning it will only be called once
**** Setter injection
**** Constructor injection
basically the same as setter except it's as constructor instead of a setter
*** Scopes
**** Singleton
***** default bean scope
***** One instantiation
***** Single instance per Spring container
***** Added with @Scope over method
**** Prototype
bean per request
***** Per request
***** Garunteed Uniq
***** Added with @Prototype overmethod
**** Web aware
***** Request
***** Session
***** Global
*** Autowired
Makes things a lot easier since you do not have to call any of the set/constructor injection for services, as long as everything has the appropriate decorators above them
**** @ComponentScan({""}) <- look for inside quote
*** Stereotypes
**** @Component
**** @Repository
**** @Service
**** @Controller
*** Advanced Bean Configuration
****  Bean Lifecycle
instantiation -> populate properties -> BeanNameAware -> BeanFactoryAware -> Pre initialization - BeanPostProcessors -> InitialaizeBean -> InitMethod -> Post init - BeanPostProcessors
**** FactoryBean
***** What?
**** SpEL (Spring Expression Language)
***** Manipualte object Graph
***** Evaluate at runtime
***** Security
@Value("#{}") can be done run time which will be injected into code.
**** Proxies
***** @Transactional
**** Profiles
***** Adapt Environments
***** Runtime Configuration
***** @Profile("")
***** Add into vm option
-Dspring.profiles.active=profileName
** Java Spring JPA
*** Spring JPA
**** Enhances JPA
**** Simplifies Data Tier
**** JpaRepository
**** Query DSL
**** Data Tier
*** JPA (Java Persistence API)
an object relation mapping - Relational tables <-> Software objects.
[Honestly sounds a lot like entity framework from .NET]
*** JPA Repository
A repository in the repositories folder that is an interface that extends from JPARepository. and that is it.
**** Spring repositories themselves do not need to be an interface
**** DAO (Data Acess Object)
*** Architecure
#+attr_html: width=100px
[[./Resources/RepoArchitecture.png][Repository Architecture]]
** Other notes
*** Keybinds
**** Ctrl + Shift + O
removes unused imports
*** PluralSight
**** Leaving the RequestMapping blank?

* Spring.io Docs
** Framework Reference
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/overview.html
*** Modules
**** Core container
contains core, beans, context, and expression language modules
***** Core & Beans
seperates configuration from dependecies
***** Beans
3 things
****** Serializable
****** something
****** something
***** Context
access objects similar to (JNDI registry)
****** JNDI Registry
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/overview/index.html
Java Naming and Direcotry interface

it is an API that provides naming and directory functionality
[[./Resources/JNDI.png]]
** The IoC Container
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html
(IoC) Inversion of Control which describes the process of a container injecting dependecies when creating beans
*** Factory Method
a design pattern that describes making objects at run time. (where all objects share the superclass)
